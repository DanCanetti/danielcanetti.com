<h1>list-to-array</h1>
<p>Simple javascript lib for converting a [comma || space] delimited string to an array.</p>
<p>Trims values so you can use human-friendly lists like <code>'one, two, three' =&gt; ['one','two','three']</code></p>
<p>If in array is provided, it is simply returned. If a falsy or non-string value is provided, an empty array is returned.</p>
<p>Won't work with values that contain spaces.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre><code>npm install list-to-array
</code></pre>
<p>Works in node.js, iojs or bundle for the browser with browserify or webpack.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code>var listToArray = require('list-to-array');

console.log(listToArray('one, two, three'));

// logs ['one','two','three']
</code></pre>
