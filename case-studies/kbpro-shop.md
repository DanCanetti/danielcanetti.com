Emerald Kitchens was due a website update to fit with it's new branding and diversified product offerings. I took up the challenge to redesign and rebuild the site, focussing on encouraging users to get in touch or pick up the phone.

The previous design was dark, difficult to navigate and hid some of the most interesting areas of the site on the secondary pages. For the new site the emphasis is now on kitchen installation, with Emerald Kitchens' unique three option approach clearly visible on the homepage and a brighter more inviting colour pallete. Continuing with the simplistic theme, the navigation focusses on the key areas the company offers and the use of a burger menu allows for more options to be added in future without compromising the design of the site.

## Mobile First

As with every site I work on, Emerald Kitchens has been developed with a 'mobile first' mentality, with fast loading times on throttled networks and a slick menu design the site can experienced on any device.
