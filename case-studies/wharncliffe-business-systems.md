Wharncliffe Business Systems were looking for a site that would allow for both content and design updates to made internally. I worked closely with their internal designer to create the site and continue to work with Wharncliffe on improvements every now and then.

As Wharncliffe were already using WordPress and we decided to continue using this CMS which would allow the content changes to be made by the buisness. In order for the designer to make changes I implemented a site builder framework called [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) and constructed the basic layout and design of the site. From there the designer continued to build out the pages for site, whilst I provided guidance where required and worked on bespoke development features.
