postExcerpt: To try and save some people mucking about as I have - here's a quick run down of three project management tools.
---

I've gone through my fair share of project management tools in the past few years. This is, as memory serves, the tools I've used so far in order:

* Zoho Projects
* Asana
* ~~Wunderlist~~ 💛💔
* Asana (Again)
* Trello
* Basecamp
* Trello (Again)

As you can see, I go back and forth alot. At the time of writing I'm in the process of moving from Basecamp to Trello, I originally moved to Basecamp because my company did so and I find it easier to use the same tool everywhere. That was a mistake.

So, to try and save some people mucking about as I have going back and forth I thought I'd do a quick run down of three of these project management tools.

## Trello 

By far my favourite (RIP [Wunderlist 💔](https://www.wunderlist.com/)), Trello offers a simple, agile approach to projects that definitely benefits those of us who need to see the whole picture all the time - from what's been done to what's on hold.

* ✅ My favourite
* ✅ Agile approach
* ✅ Easy to understand
* ✅ Visually appealing
* ✅ Free version offers a lot of functionality 
* ✅ New templating feature is really useful
* ✅ 'Butler' automation is slick
* ✅ Quick to set up initally
* ❌ Mobile App can be a bit fiddly
* ❌ Can only install one power-up on free version (choose wisely!)

## Asana

I started using Asana when I found out it was developed by Facebook founder Dustin Moskovitz, whilst I was Googling everyone in *[The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/)*, and it turned out to be a pretty good piece of kit. Unfortunately, it's probably too powerful for the needs of a single person... it's very pleasing to look at though 😍

* ✅ My go to for years
* ✅ Great for larger teams
* ✅ Visually appealing
* ✅ Easy to understand priorities
* ✅ Can choose Agile approach
* ✅ Mobile app is good
* ❌ Can be a bit overwhelming for small projects
* ❌ Not too clear these days where I stand on the free plan
* ❌ Initial Set-up takes longer than the other two

## Basecamp

I'd been hearing about Basecamp for years, when the company stated that we were going to be using this for all projects I gave it a whirl. It in the office I found it difficult to keep on top of my work, had no clue what was a priority and there just seemed to be lists everywhere but I had no clue what was what. Avoid if you're in a team any bigger than 3. That being said, when using it for myself on a much smaller scale I actually wuite liked it.

* ✅ Good for small projects
* ✅ Mobile app is good
* ✅ Quick to set up initally
* ❌ Easy to get lost in threads
* ❌ Free version is limited to three projects
* ❌ Difficult to find priorities
* ❌ Way too many emails!
