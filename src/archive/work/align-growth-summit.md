As part of my freelance work I created this site for the Annual Align Growth Summit event, this 2020 version had a facelift as well as some last minute changes due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Registration was handled by a third-party and this brochure site just linked away to that.

## Agenda

The agenda is very similar to a timeline, so much so that I'm currently working on open-sourcing so a CSV can be parsed into an agenda or timeline. It's still early days and there's much to do.

## Speakers

As this is built in [11ty](https://11ty.dev) the speakers are just a collection, each being their own subpage. They're organised on the speakers page by manipulating the `date` to order speakers by the clients preference.
