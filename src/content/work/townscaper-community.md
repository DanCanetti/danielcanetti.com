A simple Wordpress site built to allow users to save and share their [Townscaper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291340/Townscaper/) builds with one another. Recent changes include a redesign of the homepage to incorporate a Twitter feed and moving the community submissions to a [sub-page](https://townscaper.community/community-submissions).

## Community Submissions 

In the early days of Townscaper there was no option to save or share towns. Once created a user could copy some code which was the town and would have to save it in a text doc and share via the forums on Steam. I had the idea to create a simple site which would allow users to upload the code and a screenshot and share their site with others, additionally allowing them to come back and grab the code whenever they like.

To grab some code all a user needs to do is access the desired town and click on the Copy Code button. There's a handy bit of JS which'll copy this for them and pop it in the clipboard for use in the game.
