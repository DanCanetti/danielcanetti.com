postExcerpt: Everyone works differently and I love it. I follow a few too many set-up focussed Instagram accounts and have been watching Setup Wars, TLD, and Oliur for as long as I can remember. I'm still working on my ideal set-up and I'll keep this page updated with all the latest tech and workflow tools I use.

Everyone works differently and I love it. I follow a few too many set-up focussed Instagram accounts and have been watching [Setup Wars](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTW2MN17j-L12h8Jq5fGGt8VV1ISZT-De), [TLD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDlQwv99CovKafGvxyaiNDA), [Oliur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzJjUHizQfPYywqt1mSEMww) for as long as I can remember. I'm still working on my ideal set-up and I'll keep this page updated with all the latest tech and workflow tools I use.

## Mac Mini

![Mac Mini](/images/posts/current-setup/mac-mini.jpg)

My daily driver. All of my design and development work is done on this machine and to keep it clean and fast I store everything on Google Drive.

## iPad Mini

My version of a second screen. I have this little iPad sat just to the bottom left of my monitor, with either Trello or Netflix on it.

## Sony WH-1000XM2 Headphones

![Sony WH-1000XM2 Headphones](/images/posts/current-setup/sony-mx.jpg)

I was gifted these for Christmas last year, and man do I love them. Useful for blocking out the surrounding noise both in a busy office and on my travels.

## Magic Mouse

![Magic Mouse](/images/posts/current-setup/magic-mouse.jpg)

I never realised how useful being able to scroll horizonally could be until I used one of these and the battery life is suprisingly good. The only downside to these is the charging port being underneath the mouse - rendering it useless while charging.

## Magic Keyboard

![Magic Keyboard](/images/posts/current-setup/magic-keyboard.jpg)

What's so magic about it? I can't tell you. It functions like every other keyboard... it just looks awesome and if you invest in the space grey Magic Mouse you need one of these to match!

## Monzo

![Monzo](/images/posts/current-setup/monzo.jpg)

I use Monzo primarily for my day-to-day spending, but I'm a particular fan of their 'Pots' which you can set up really quickly to money aside and the best part - you can automatically round up transactions and put the difference in a Pot... you can save without knowing it!

## Atom

![Atom](/images/posts/current-setup/atom.jpg)

My code editor of choice, it's super powerful and has free extensions for everything you need. I can recommend the file-icons extension, it improves the gui and allows me to quickly identify file types in the tree.

## Trello

![Trello](/images/posts/current-setup/trello.jpg)

After being introduced to Trello whilst working at Nouveau Beauty Group I began to move away from Asana and use Trello for my freelance work too. It's simplicity and ease-of-use were just winners for me.

## Google Drive

![Google Drive](/images/posts/current-setup/drive.jpg)

As I menioned earlier, to keep my Mac Mini clean and running as fast as possible I store most of my files on Google Drive. I'm currently investigating what else G Suite has to offer.
